Activity Management (CRUD):
Implement the ability to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) fitness activities.
Each fitness activity should have the following attributes: Activity Type (e.g., Running, Cycling, Weightlifting), Duration (in minutes), Distance (in km or miles), Calories Burned, Date, and User ID.
Ensure validation for required fields such as Activity Type, Duration, and Date.
Users Management (CRUD):

Implement CRUD operations for users.
Each user should have a unique Username, Email, and Password.
Users should only be able to manage their own activities.
Implement permission checks to ensure users cannot modify or delete activities logged by other users.
View Activity History:

Create an endpoint to allow users to view their activity history.
The endpoint should display all activities logged by the user, including activity details like Type, Duration, Calories Burned, and Date.
Add optional filters, such as viewing activities by Date Range or filtering by Activity Type (e.g., show only running activities).
Activity Metrics:

Provide an endpoint that allows users to see a summary of their activities, such as the total duration of activities in a given period, total distance covered, and total calories burned.
Optionally, display activity trends over time (e.g., weekly or monthly activity tracking).



Database:
Use Django ORM to interact with the database.
Define models for Activities and Users.
Ensure each activity is associated with the user who logged it, and users can only access their own activity records.
Authentication:

Implement user authentication using Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication system.
Users must be logged in to create, update, or delete their fitness activities.
Optionally, implement token-based authentication (JWT) to secure the API further.
API Design:

Use Django Rest Framework (DRF) to design and expose the necessary API endpoints.
Follow RESTful principles by using appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Ensure proper error handling with relevant HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 for not found, 400 for bad request).
Deployment:

Deploy the API on Heroku or PythonAnywhere.
Ensure the API is accessible, secure, and performs well in the deployed environment.
Pagination and Sorting:

Add pagination to the list of activities for users with extensive activity histories.
Provide sorting options such as sorting activities by Date, Duration, or Calories Burned.


Goal Setting: Add a feature where users can set fitness goals (e.g., running 50 km in a month) and track their progress towards these goals.
Workout Plans: Implement a feature that allows users to create and log workout plans that consist of multiple activities (e.g., a weekly workout routine).
Activity Sharing: Create endpoints for users to share their fitness achievements or specific activities with other users or on social media platforms.
Leaderboards: Implement leaderboards where users can see who has logged the most activities, distance, or calories burned within a community of users.
Notifications and Reminders: Add a notification system that reminds users to log their activities or alerts them when they achieve specific fitness goals.
Integration with Wearables: Optionally, provide an endpoint to integrate with fitness trackers or wearables, allowing users to automatically log activities from devices such as smartwatches.
